In it, racial issues are only indirectly addressed, gentility is a concern ranking only second to salvation, and humility and obedience are prerequisites to a woman's acceptance by the Christian community. In essence, this is a novel of socialization rather than of social protest.

In 1923, in a small town outside Warsaw, a Polish innkeeper with five daughters at last has a son. Strangely, Chaim Turkow is blond and blue-eyed, a Jew with Aryan features. As the child grows, the entire town learns of his genius, for Chaim's mind is insatiable, his memory flawless. But after a mysterious accident in a steam bath, the boy changes. His ways are odd, he rarely speaks, and he cares only for his sketching. Chaim Turkow is sixteen when the Nazis bring their awful whirlwind to Poland. His parents send him away, hoping his looks will save him. The boy finds work with a wealthy Pole; he lives in a pigsty; as a final protection, he feigns mute idiocy. But though \"the beautiful fool\" has no voice, his vision remains clear, and the horror he sees drives him toward madness. Ultimately, it is his passion for memory, for bearing witness, that saves Chaim and revives his faith in the human spirit. Lawrence Rudner's story recalls a world consumed by evil. Yet The Magic We Do Here is written in the timeless language of folktales; it shimmers with warmth, humor, and great wisdom.

London ad-man Michael Sayers, 27, is seriously injured in an IRA bombing at Waterloo Station--a Christmastime blast that also kills his younger sister and his beloved fianc√¢‚Ç¨≈°e. And, since Michael caught a glimpse of the fleeing terrorists just before the explosion, his evidence helps the police to track down the IRA bombers--one of whom is captured, convicted, sentenced to life imprisonment. Otherwise, however, Michael has no interest in revenge: crippled for life, near-catatonic from shock, he wants only to withdraw into himself. So, with a loyal dog, a chess set, and little else, he goes off to hunt and meditate in an isolated rural cabin. But Michael's solitude is about to be interrupted--because when that imprisoned terrorist dies from an unsuccessful hunger strike, the IRA decides to take revenge on witness Michael Sayers: a super-villain named Temple is dispatched from Ireland to terrorize Michael, then kill him. Meanwhile, too, Michael is slowly coming out of his surly funk, thanks largely to the quirky seductiveness of brusque young neighbor Jeanne Palmer. Thus, by the time Temple arrives to begin his nasty assault, Michael has regained the will to live--along with a plucky bedmate/ally in Jeanne. And though Temple does fully succeed in killing Michael's two best friends (one canine, one human), the woodsy death-duel finale leads--thanks largely to Jeanne's kamikaze attack in a Range Rover--to a happy fade-out. Unlike the very best terrorism-novelists, Kerrigan doesn't manage to humanize or even flesh out the IRA assassin here; so the alternating focus, constantly moving back and forth between Michael and Temple, is only half-satisfying. Still, with echoes of Victor Canning, Jack Higgins, and other crisply British suspense-men, this is a predictable yet involving blend of tried-and-true ingredients: low-key sentiment, offbeat romance, cat-and-mouse tension, and sporadically fierce action.","GoodreadsLink":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/443866.Dead_Ground?ac=1&from_search=true","ISBN":"312184964","PubYear":"1985","BibNum":"399123"},{"TitleClean":"Lead Pencil","Subtitle":"Stories and Sketches","AuthorClean":"Botwinik, Berl","AuthorMore":"","Remove":"","ImageUrl":"https://archive.org/services/img/leadpencilstorie00botw","GoodreadsRating":"2","GoodreadsReviews":"1","Category":"jews, social life, translation","GoodreadsDes":"Twenty stories describe the experiences of Jewish immigrants trying to adapt to life in their new country, America","GoodreadsLink":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3836342-lead-pencil","ISBN":"814317456","PubYear":"1984","BibNum":"360632"},{"TitleClean":"The Priestess of Henge","Subtitle":"","AuthorClean":"Burnett, David","AuthorMore":"","Remove":"","ImageUrl":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1381353227l/3241109.jpg","GoodreadsRating":"3.7","GoodreadsReviews":"10","Category":"children's stories","GoodreadsDes":"The tedious rise of a Bronze Age Evita from waif to priestess and goddess, with one of her men responsible for Stonehenge. (\"\"Once finished, the gaps between some of the posts will create sighting lines, with Midsummer sunrise, the setting of the Midwinter moon. . . Not only will we have built a temple, but a form of calendar.\"\") Morrigen, daughter of a fierce hag who intends to sell her to a swineherd, uses her native cunning and enchanting beauty to travel to Henge, where she serves under the High Priestess Istar; she wheedles a hot tip about a coming eclipse from an ancient seer, arranges his death, and rises in the Priestess ranks. Meanwhile, three men have caught Morrigen fever: merchant Atia, warrior Ceruduc, and Hyra--the future Seer of Sacred Rites who will plot out Stonehenge. And Morrigen uses them all in her schemes to defeat the dominant Duboni tribe, who are enslaving the more sensitive Cunei. Later, the men will come and go: mighty Ceruduc sulks and boozes in his tent for love unrequited; Atia is off trading; Hyra, weary of wife Lyla, departs for the Dark Seas and brings back some bright architectural ideas. But Morrigen steadily reigns as a benevolent dictator of a High Priestess, even embarking on conquests after the birth of her son Tyrus (by dutiful Ceruduc), while the Henge is a-building. Then comes the Plague and a hard winter, Soothsayers are no help. (\"\"Now let's go through the portents again. You've checked the goat?\"\") And, after the pseudo-sacrifice of her son (he's already dead of the plague), Morrigen--now a Goddess--seeks immortality, sinks into madness, prowls the plains with her lynxes, invents writing, and does herself in. Loony lady Morrigen has a smidgin of pizazz, but reading this is like sledging a Stone. . . uphill.","GoodreadsLink":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3241109-the-priestess-of-henge?ac=1&from_search=true","ISBN":"241107539","PubYear":"1982","BibNum":"357489"},{"TitleClean":"The Best of Thomas N.

Barbara Rees has always been a very good writer (Try Another Country and Diminishing circles)--astute and dispassionate; it is both a mark of the success and the failure of this novel that it ends much too soon, and too abruptly, shortchanging our expectations.","GoodreadsLink":"","ISBN":"006013528X","PubYear":"1976","BibNum":"23329"},{"TitleClean":"The Monarch","Subtitle":"","AuthorClean":"Vasilikos, Vasilƒìs","AuthorMore":"","Remove":"","ImageUrl":"https://covers.openlibrary.org/w/id/4650613-M.jpg","GoodreadsRating":"3.5","GoodreadsReviews":"4","Category":"fiction","GoodreadsDes":"ŒàŒΩŒ±œÇ ŒÜœÅŒ±Œ≤Œ±œÇ ŒºŒøŒΩŒ¨œÅœáŒ∑œÇ -œÑœçœÄŒøœÇ Œ£ŒπœáŒ±ŒΩŒøœçŒ∫- œÄŒøœÖ Œ≠œáŒµŒπ ŒµŒæŒøœÅŒπœÉœÑŒµŒØ Œ±œÄœå œÑŒøœÖœÇ Œ∫œåŒ∫Œ∫ŒπŒΩŒøœÖœÇ ŒºŒøœÖœÜœÑŒÆŒ¥ŒµœÇ œÉœÑŒ∑ Œ°œéŒºŒ∑ -ŒµŒΩ ŒµŒØŒ¥ŒµŒπ ŒöœâŒΩœÉœÑŒ±ŒΩœÑŒØŒΩŒøœÖ ŒìŒªœçŒæŒºœÄŒøœÖœÅŒ≥Œ∫-, Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ≠ŒΩŒ±œÇ Œ¥ŒπŒ±ŒΩŒøŒøœçŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ œÄŒøœÖ ŒµŒ≥Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ŒØœÉœÑŒ±œÑŒ±Œπ œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒëŒπœéŒΩŒπŒ±\nŒ†œåŒªŒ∑ Œ≥ŒπŒ± ŒΩŒ± œÉœÖŒ≥Œ≥œÅŒ¨œàŒµŒπ œÑŒ∑ Œ≤ŒπŒøŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒµŒæœåœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÖ Œ¨ŒΩŒ±Œ∫œÑŒ±, Œ±œÄŒøœÑŒµŒªŒøœçŒΩ œÑŒøœÖœÇ Œ¥œçŒø Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒ∫ŒøœçœÇ ŒÆœÅœâŒµœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒºœÖŒ∏ŒπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ.\nŒ†ŒøŒπŒøŒπ œåŒºœâœÇ Œ≤œÅŒØœÉŒ∫ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ Œ±œÄœå œÄŒØœÉœâ œÑŒøœÖœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ŒøœÅŒØŒ∂ŒøœÖŒΩ œÑŒ∑ Œ∂œâŒÆ œÑŒøœÖœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑŒøŒΩ Œ∏Œ¨ŒΩŒ±œÑœå œÑŒøœÖœÇ œÉŒ±ŒΩ ŒΩŒ± ŒµœÄœÅœåŒ∫ŒµŒπœÑŒø Œ≥ŒπŒ± Œ±ŒΩŒÆŒºœÄŒøœÅŒµœÇ ŒºŒ±œÅŒπŒøŒΩŒ≠œÑŒµœÇ; Œ†ŒøŒπŒøŒπ ŒµœÄŒπŒ∏œÖŒºŒøœçŒΩ œÑŒ∑ Œ¥ŒøŒªŒøœÜŒøŒΩŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒºŒøŒΩŒ¨œÅœáŒ∑; Œ†œéœÇ ŒøŒπ ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ±ŒªŒøŒµŒ∫Œ¥œåœÑŒµœÇ Œ≥ŒΩœâœÅŒØŒ∂ŒøœÖŒΩ œÑŒ∑ œÉœáŒµŒ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∂œåŒºŒµŒΩŒ∑ ŒµŒ∫œÑŒ≠ŒªŒµœÉŒÆ œÑŒøœÖ; ŒúŒÆœÄœâœÇ Œ≠œáŒøœÖŒΩ œÄŒªŒ∑œÅŒøœÜŒøœÅŒØŒµœÇ Œ±œÄœå œÑŒπœÇ œÄŒøŒªœÖŒµŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ œÄŒµœÑœÅŒµŒªŒ±ŒØŒøœÖ, Œ±œÄœå œÑŒπœÇ ŒøœÄŒøŒØŒµœÇ ŒµŒæŒ±œÅœÑœéŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ; ŒöŒ±Œπ Œ≥ŒπŒ±œÑŒØ œÄŒπŒ≠Œ∂ŒøœÖŒΩ œÑŒøŒΩ œÉœÖŒ≥Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒ≠Œ± ŒΩŒ± œÉœÄŒµœçœÉŒµŒπ ŒΩŒ± œÄŒ¨œÅŒµŒπ œÉœÖŒΩŒµŒΩœÑŒµœçŒæŒµŒπœÇ Œ±œÄœå œÑŒøŒΩ ŒºŒøŒΩŒ¨œÅœáŒ∑, œéœÉœÑŒµ ŒΩŒ± ŒøŒªŒøŒ∫ŒªŒ∑œÅœéœÉŒµŒπ œÑŒ∑ Œ≤ŒπŒøŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ; ŒìŒπŒ±œÑŒØ ŒµœÄŒπœÄœÅœåœÉŒ∏ŒµœÑŒ± Œ∏Œ≠ŒªŒøœÖŒΩ œÑŒø Œ∫ŒµŒØŒºŒµŒΩŒø ŒΩŒ± ŒºŒµœÑŒ±œÄŒªŒ±œÉœÑŒµŒØ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÉŒµ œÉŒµŒΩŒ¨œÅŒπŒø œÑŒ±ŒπŒΩŒØŒ±œÇ; ŒúŒµ œÄŒøŒπŒø œÑœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒπŒ∫œå œÑœÅœåœÄŒø Œ≠ŒΩŒ±œÇ œÉœâœÉŒØŒ±œÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒºŒøŒΩŒ¨œÅœáŒ∑, Œ¥ŒπŒ¨œÉŒ∑ŒºŒøœÇ Œ∑Œ∏ŒøœÄŒøŒπœåœÇ, Œ±ŒΩœÑŒØ ŒΩŒ± œÖœÄŒøŒ¥œÖŒ∏ŒµŒØ œÑŒøŒΩ œÅœåŒªŒø œÑŒøœÖ ŒµŒæœåœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÖ Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒπŒ¨ œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÑŒ±ŒπŒΩŒØŒ±, Œ≠œÄŒ±ŒπŒæŒµ œÑŒµŒªŒπŒ∫Œ¨ Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ŒøœÅŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œå œÅœåŒªŒø œÉœÑŒ∑ Œ∂œâŒÆ œÑŒøœÖ; ŒìŒπŒ±œÑŒØ Œ≠ŒΩŒ±œÇ Œ¥ŒπŒµœÖŒ∏œÖŒΩœÑŒÆœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒµŒ∫Œ¥ŒøœÑŒπŒ∫Œøœç ŒøŒØŒ∫ŒøœÖ Œ≤œÅŒ≠Œ∏Œ∑Œ∫Œµ Œ∫œÅŒµŒºŒ±œÉŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÇ œÉœÑŒø œÉœÄŒØœÑŒπ œÑŒøœÖ œÉœÑŒø Œ†Œ±œÅŒØœÉŒπ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œø œÉœÖŒ≥Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒ≠Œ±œÇ- Œ≤ŒπŒøŒ≥œÅŒ¨œÜŒøœÇ ŒµŒæŒ±œÜŒ±ŒΩŒØœÉŒ∏Œ∑Œ∫Œµ œÉŒµ œáŒπŒøŒΩŒπœÉŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒµœÇ ŒµŒªŒ≤ŒµœÑŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ œáŒ±œÅŒ¨Œ¥œÅŒµœÇ, ŒµŒΩœé Œ∑ œáŒÆœÅŒ± œÑŒøœÖ œÄœÅŒøœÉœÄŒ±Œ∏ŒµŒØ ŒΩŒ± ŒµŒΩœÑŒøœÄŒØœÉŒµŒπ œÑŒ± œáŒµŒπœÅœåŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒ¨ œÑŒøœÖ;\nŒ§ŒπœÇ Œ±œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒÆœÉŒµŒπœÇ œÉœÑŒ± œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÄŒ¨ŒΩœâ ŒµœÅœâœÑŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒ± Œ∏Œ± œÑŒπœÇ Œ≤œÅŒµŒπ Œø Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒΩœéœÉœÑŒ∑œÇ ŒºŒ≠œÉŒ± œÉœÑŒπœÇ œÉŒµŒªŒØŒ¥ŒµœÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ≤ŒπŒ≤ŒªŒØŒøœÖ, œåœÄŒøœÖ ŒµŒΩŒ±ŒªŒªŒ¨œÉœÉŒøŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ Œ±œÄŒµŒπŒ∫ŒøŒΩŒØœÉŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒºŒ±Œ≥ŒµœÖœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ Œ°œéŒºŒ∑œÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒºœÖŒ∏ŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒïœÖœÜœÅŒ¨œÑŒµŒπŒ±œÇ ŒºŒµ œÉŒ∫Œ∑ŒΩŒ≠œÇ Œ≠ŒΩœÑŒøŒΩŒ∑œÇ Œ¥œÅŒ¨œÉŒ∑œÇ, Œ∫Œπ œåœÄŒøœÖ œÑŒπœÇ ŒªœÖœÅŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ Œ±œÄŒøœÑœÖœÄœéœÉŒµŒπœÇ ŒµŒæŒøŒºŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒÆœÉŒµœâŒΩ œÑŒπœÇ Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ¥Œ≠œáŒøŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ Œ∫œÖŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ œÄŒµœÅŒπŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒ≠œÇ œÄŒøŒªŒπœÑŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ œÄŒ±Œ∏œéŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒµœÅœâœÑŒπŒ∫Œøœç œÄŒ¨Œ∏ŒøœÖœÇ.","GoodreadsLink":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4792353-the-monarch?from_search=true","ISBN":"672521393","PubYear":"1976","BibNum":"805687"},{"TitleClean":"Hear, ye sons","Subtitle":"A Novel","AuthorClean":"Fineman, Irving","AuthorMore":"","Remove":"","ImageUrl":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=R6lRAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE73WcODd8bqqswnu6O1fG87JQuJv4_rsMcHV98i2uvI0JM1vjWpqN7P6-NoaSn9hQOV1O8NjLzMVesbnxwu3WHw5BYnAqyPEmXdAlmJO0b6q0JLCTNBLdgi5QvOvcHUrh4Bsjj8w","GoodreadsRating":"0","GoodreadsReviews":"0","Category":"jews, fiction","GoodreadsDes":"A book for which we prophesy a tremendous Jewish market and the same sort of general market that THE ISLAND WITHIN by Ludwig Lewisohn achieved.

Shot through with legend, folk lore, and graphic pictures of the rites and ceremonies of the church. It is the story of a young Jew, of his education at the Rabbinical school, of his love, his betrothal to an unknown maiden, his marriage, of conscription and oppression under the Russian military heel, of his escape to America. The story itself ends there. The prologue (which should be read last) paints in broad strokes his subsequent rise to material success, and challenges the measure of success in the distance the modern Jew has sprung from the faith of his fathers. The title is an appeal to the young Jews to hearken to the splendor of their heritage.

While the Brook dowager, Aunt Miriam, presides at a distance -- closer to, she looks like the \"\"Queen Mum\"\" -- Gail, Kit's daughter and as sexually restless as her father, delivers the central romance with Keith Anvers, a lawyer from the river flats otherwise known as the wrong side of the tracks. . . .

Danny Sands speaks from his extended \"\"family\"\" of Pine Street in Detroit. His ghetto childhood separates those who are \"\"equipped for the battle of being black\"\" and those who are not. The survivors are often orphans: Danny, who was found in a garbage can by Uncle Ambrose: Laurie whose prostitute mother was strangled to death; Adam and Jeff whose baby sister died waiting for medical attention in a clinic, pitching their mother into a mental institution; George who enjoyed the rare privilege of a father only to have it eroded by the degradation of \"\"Whitey.\"\" Danny and his friends mature into their individual roles of adjustment: social work, Civil Rights, crime or prostitution, an admixture of historical escapes and new-born resistances. When the ten days of riots erupt in July of 1067, Pine Street makes the papers for its \"\"Paradox\"\"--two black men shot by National Guardsmen attempting to rescue a 90-year-old woman from a burning house, and the dead body of a pregnant black girl flung in protection across the lifeless body of a while flower child. These are Danny's friends, all innocent victims. The author makes sure there is no mystery in the tragedy and that one understands the difference between murder and inverted justice. . . .

He looked around upon the place, the houses, the lawns, and then a lighted window caught his eye and he realized that he was passing Bradford Waters' house. \"I wonder if she is back at home?\" he said. \"I caused her so much grief.\" He passed through the gate, and crept up to the window. The light shone through a thin shade, but he could see nothing within the house. After a short while, however, he heard the sound of women's voices, and one was hers. Without warning, all the pent-up feeling of the past three years burst forth in the cry, \" Mary!\" \"What's that?\" cried some one within, but there was no answer save the hurried tread of feet across the floor. Aware of what he had done, he was hurrying away, when the front door was thrown open, and he saw her before him standing in a flood of light. Then he could not go. He stood transfixed until she walked down the steps to him crying,\" Robert, Robert, I was sure you would come!\" And all he could do was to bow his head and murmur, \"Thank God.\" She took him by the hand and led him into the house, he unresisting. \"Here is Robert,\" she said to Nannie. \"Did I not tell you he would come?\" \"Yes, and I am glad with you.\" Her greeting of Robert was tender, almost sisterly. As soon as she could do so tactfully, she left the room, and Van Doren's glance followed her questioningly. He could not understand her subdued manner, her sad face. Mary saw the look in his eyes and asked, \"Do you not know, ...","GoodreadsLink":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2046750.The_Fanatics_?ac=1&from_search=true","ISBN":"","PubYear":"1969","BibNum":"1359787"},{"TitleClean":"Aunt Sara‚Äôs Wooden God","Subtitle":"","AuthorClean":"Gilbert, Mercedes","AuthorMore":"","Remove":"","ImageUrl":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1501549604l/35069983.jpg","GoodreadsRating":"0","GoodreadsReviews":"0","Category":"african american fiction, country life, mothers and sons","GoodreadsDes":"Aunt Sara takes pride in both her sons, mixed-race William and his half-brother, Jim. While hard-working Jim remains at home to tend to the farm, William heads for the bright lights of Macon, ostensibly to study theology. But his cold, hard, and calculating nature steers William away from school and toward the low company of the city's gambling dens. Worse yet, his jealous rivalry with Jim for the affections of their childhood playmate leads William to a dreadful act of betrayal.\n\"This is an authentic everyday story of thousands of little families below the Mason-Dixon line, bound to the soil by poverty and blackness, but living their enclosed lives always in the hope that someday some one of them may escape the family group and go on to higher things,\" noted Langston Hughes. In his Foreword to Mercedes Gilbert's 1938 novel of small-town rural life in the South, Hughes offered favorable comparisons to Jonah's Gourd Vine by Zora Neale Hurston and George Henderson's Ollie Miss. Decades later, the book remains an important document of African-American social history.","GoodreadsLink":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35069983-aunt-sara-s-wooden-god?ac=1&from_search=true","ISBN":"","PubYear":"1969","BibNum":"3004213"},{"TitleClean":"In the House of the Lord","Subtitle":"","AuthorClean":"Flynn, Robert","AuthorMore":"","Remove":"","ImageUrl":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347435004l/2665979.jpg","GoodreadsRating":"4.09","GoodreadsReviews":"11","Category":"texas, fiction","GoodreadsDes":"Robert Flynn‚Äôs second novel tracks a day in the life of Pat Shahan, minister of a Protestant church in a large city. Young, devout, and honest, Shahan seeks revelation‚Äîand is offered a revolving neon cross for the church steeple; he seeks vision‚Äîand gets a pep talk from the church treasurer. Striving to serve the Lord, he is dragged into a ‚ÄúGreat Crusade‚Äù which is nothing more than a publicity stunt that ends disastrously. Shahan‚Äôs day sees him ministering to the sick and dying, pacifying angry parishioners and counseling troubled ones, seeking inspiration for a sermon, trying to calm his mother by phone, and losing patience with his family. Pat Shahan is a thoroughly human minister.\n\nThroughout his day‚Äîand by extension his ministry‚Äîhe struggles to balance his faith in Christianity with his doubts about himself and his church. His story gives a pulpit-eye view of organized religion, a view that is occasionally humorous, sometimes affectionate, always open-minded, and ultimately affirmative. ‚ÄúThere is darkness in the world,‚Äù says Shahan, ‚Äúbut there is also light.\"","GoodreadsLink":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2665979-in-the-house-of-the-lord?from_search=true","ISBN":"","PubYear":"1969","BibNum":"87847"},{"TitleClean":"Fractions","Subtitle":"A Novel","AuthorClean":"Field, Andrew","AuthorMore":"","Remove":"","ImageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61It2kiMQGL.jpg","GoodreadsRating":"3","GoodreadsReviews":"3","Category":"","GoodreadsDes":"Fractions = 1/3 talent, 1/8 gall, 2/5 candid concupiscence, 1/4 shock of recognition, 1/9 wordplay along with recondite referrals, and 1/7 playful permutations. Some of this is inherited from the Maestro since Andrew Field, you may remember, did the serious study of Nabokov two years ago. Here Field is reintroduced in a querulous foreword by Forward, a former friend and editor whose wife he later claims to have shared. But for the purposes of Fractions he appears as Dirk Yarborough, married to said wife Victoria although the union becomes more and more lackluster. During this time Yarborough is annexed by Jenny Lincoln (whose other name is Mary FitzWilson and you'll get no help on that one) to do reviews for her little \"\"serious\"\" magazine Atheneum. And also drifting in and out of Atheneum and the subject of much literary discussion is one Dick Upjohn who will certainly need no further identification. If none of the above fractions quite prove out, neither does this as a novel although there are enough brighter moments to assure Mr. Field some of the attention he is trying to get. . . .
