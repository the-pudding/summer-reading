In 1923, in a small town outside Warsaw, a Polish innkeeper with five daughters at last has a son. Strangely, Chaim Turkow is blond and blue-eyed, a Jew with Aryan features. As the child grows, the entire town learns of his genius, for Chaim's mind is insatiable, his memory flawless. But after a mysterious accident in a steam bath, the boy changes. His ways are odd, he rarely speaks, and he cares only for his sketching. Chaim Turkow is sixteen when the Nazis bring their awful whirlwind to Poland. His parents send him away, hoping his looks will save him. The boy finds work with a wealthy Pole; he lives in a pigsty; as a final protection, he feigns mute idiocy. But though \"the beautiful fool\" has no voice, his vision remains clear, and the horror he sees drives him toward madness. Ultimately, it is his passion for memory, for bearing witness, that saves Chaim and revives his faith in the human spirit. Lawrence Rudner's story recalls a world consumed by evil. Yet The Magic We Do Here is written in the timeless language of folktales; it shimmers with warmth, humor, and great wisdom.

London ad-man Michael Sayers, 27, is seriously injured in an IRA bombing at Waterloo Station--a Christmastime blast that also kills his younger sister and his beloved fiancâ€še. And, since Michael caught a glimpse of the fleeing terrorists just before the explosion, his evidence helps the police to track down the IRA bombers--one of whom is captured, convicted, sentenced to life imprisonment. Otherwise, however, Michael has no interest in revenge: crippled for life, near-catatonic from shock, he wants only to withdraw into himself. So, with a loyal dog, a chess set, and little else, he goes off to hunt and meditate in an isolated rural cabin. But Michael's solitude is about to be interrupted--because when that imprisoned terrorist dies from an unsuccessful hunger strike, the IRA decides to take revenge on witness Michael Sayers: a super-villain named Temple is dispatched from Ireland to terrorize Michael, then kill him. Meanwhile, too, Michael is slowly coming out of his surly funk, thanks largely to the quirky seductiveness of brusque young neighbor Jeanne Palmer. Thus, by the time Temple arrives to begin his nasty assault, Michael has regained the will to live--along with a plucky bedmate/ally in Jeanne. And though Temple does fully succeed in killing Michael's two best friends (one canine, one human), the woodsy death-duel finale leads--thanks largely to Jeanne's kamikaze attack in a Range Rover--to a happy fade-out. Unlike the very best terrorism-novelists, Kerrigan doesn't manage to humanize or even flesh out the IRA assassin here; so the alternating focus, constantly moving back and forth between Michael and Temple, is only half-satisfying. Still, with echoes of Victor Canning, Jack Higgins, and other crisply British suspense-men, this is a predictable yet involving blend of tried-and-true ingredients: low-key sentiment, offbeat romance, cat-and-mouse tension, and sporadically fierce action.","GoodreadsLink":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/443866.Dead_Ground?ac=1&from_search=true","ISBN":"312184964","PubYear":"1985","BibNum":"399123"},{"TitleClean":"Lead Pencil","Subtitle":"Stories and Sketches","AuthorClean":"Botwinik, Berl","AuthorMore":"","Remove":"","ImageUrl":"https://archive.org/services/img/leadpencilstorie00botw","GoodreadsRating":"2","GoodreadsReviews":"1","Category":"jews, social life, translation","GoodreadsDes":"Twenty stories describe the experiences of Jewish immigrants trying to adapt to life in their new country, America","GoodreadsLink":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3836342-lead-pencil","ISBN":"814317456","PubYear":"1984","BibNum":"360632"},{"TitleClean":"The Priestess of Henge","Subtitle":"","AuthorClean":"Burnett, David","AuthorMore":"","Remove":"","ImageUrl":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1381353227l/3241109.jpg","GoodreadsRating":"3.7","GoodreadsReviews":"10","Category":"children's stories","GoodreadsDes":"The tedious rise of a Bronze Age Evita from waif to priestess and goddess, with one of her men responsible for Stonehenge. (\"\"Once finished, the gaps between some of the posts will create sighting lines, with Midsummer sunrise, the setting of the Midwinter moon. . . Not only will we have built a temple, but a form of calendar.\"\") Morrigen, daughter of a fierce hag who intends to sell her to a swineherd, uses her native cunning and enchanting beauty to travel to Henge, where she serves under the High Priestess Istar; she wheedles a hot tip about a coming eclipse from an ancient seer, arranges his death, and rises in the Priestess ranks. Meanwhile, three men have caught Morrigen fever: merchant Atia, warrior Ceruduc, and Hyra--the future Seer of Sacred Rites who will plot out Stonehenge. And Morrigen uses them all in her schemes to defeat the dominant Duboni tribe, who are enslaving the more sensitive Cunei. Later, the men will come and go: mighty Ceruduc sulks and boozes in his tent for love unrequited; Atia is off trading; Hyra, weary of wife Lyla, departs for the Dark Seas and brings back some bright architectural ideas. But Morrigen steadily reigns as a benevolent dictator of a High Priestess, even embarking on conquests after the birth of her son Tyrus (by dutiful Ceruduc), while the Henge is a-building. Then comes the Plague and a hard winter, Soothsayers are no help. (\"\"Now let's go through the portents again. You've checked the goat?\"\") And, after the pseudo-sacrifice of her son (he's already dead of the plague), Morrigen--now a Goddess--seeks immortality, sinks into madness, prowls the plains with her lynxes, invents writing, and does herself in. Loony lady Morrigen has a smidgin of pizazz, but reading this is like sledging a Stone. . . uphill.","GoodreadsLink":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3241109-the-priestess-of-henge?ac=1&from_search=true","ISBN":"241107539","PubYear":"1982","BibNum":"357489"},{"TitleClean":"The Best of Thomas N.

There is a suggestion of Zangwill's CHILDREN OF THE GHETTO, of a generation ago, in the theme, Recommended for the beauty, simplicity and sincerity of handling, and for the vivid picture it draws of the life of devout orthodox Jews in a Polish village in 1865. Shot through with legend, folk lore, and graphic pictures of the rites and ceremonies of the church. It is the story of a young Jew, of his education at the Rabbinical school, of his love, his betrothal to an unknown maiden, his marriage, of conscription and oppression under the Russian military heel, of his escape to America. The story itself ends there.

They almost crowd out the story even if you enjoy getting to know them. Sturt, as it was in the beginning generations ago, has always been controlled by the Brooks -- a law unto themselves with a way of altogether disregarding the Seventh Commandment. Now the current Kit Brook's wife has been killed -- but by whom? Perhaps the \"\"Poor Sam\"\" of Mrs. Minter who does domestic work in several households to support her second husband and assorted offspring. While the Brook dowager, Aunt Miriam, presides at a distance -- closer to, she looks like the \"\"Queen Mum\"\" -- Gail, Kit's daughter and as sexually restless as her father, delivers the central romance with Keith Anvers, a lawyer from the river flats otherwise known as the wrong side of the tracks. . . . Valerie Elliston tells her on-and-off story with time and sympathy to spare -- it might appeal to those who liked the early Sumner Locke Elliott -- a traditional-modern novel which doesn't coddle sentimentality or tamper with life as it might so easily be anywhere.","GoodreadsLink":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4643299-coward-s-paradise?ac=1&from_search=true","ISBN":"60112433","PubYear":"1975","BibNum":"38197"},{"TitleClean":"Solomon’s Folly","Subtitle":"A Novel","AuthorClean":"Croxford, Leslie","AuthorMore":"","Remove":"","ImageUrl":"https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780701120351-us.jpg","GoodreadsRating":"0","GoodreadsReviews":"0","Category":"","GoodreadsDes":"","GoodreadsLink":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3737602-solomon-s-folly?ac=1&from_search=true","ISBN":"814907636","PubYear":"1974","BibNum":"125417"},{"TitleClean":"American Voices, American Women","Subtitle":"","AuthorClean":"Edwards, Lee R. | Diamond, Arlyn","AuthorMore":"","Remove":"","ImageUrl":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1301430130l/3417989.jpg","GoodreadsRating":"4","GoodreadsReviews":"2","Category":"american literature, women authors","GoodreadsDes":"","GoodreadsLink":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3417989-american-voices-american-women?from_search=true","ISBN":"380178711","PubYear":"1973","BibNum":"51678"},{"TitleClean":"No","Subtitle":"A Novel","AuthorClean":"Major, Clarence","AuthorMore":"","Remove":"","ImageUrl":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1437630649l/25957675.jpg","GoodreadsRating":"4","GoodreadsReviews":"1","Category":"african american, fiction","GoodreadsDes":"","GoodreadsLink":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25957675-no","ISBN":"878290060","PubYear":"1973","BibNum":"60905"},{"TitleClean":"Call the Beast Thy Brother","Subtitle":"","AuthorClean":"Turner, William","AuthorMore":"","Remove":"","ImageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51XDemRI6dL._SX312_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg","GoodreadsRating":"3","GoodreadsReviews":"1","Category":"hiada indians, fiction","GoodreadsDes":"What makes survival even more tentative is the character of David's companion in slavery, the Rev.

And yet the church itself is never blamed for this near tragic condition; Miss Cullinan's peo ple are exposed as inert and self seeking, trapped in family relation ships that begin and end at zero.

Danny Sands speaks from his extended \"\"family\"\" of Pine Street in Detroit. His ghetto childhood separates those who are \"\"equipped for the battle of being black\"\" and those who are not. The survivors are often orphans: Danny, who was found in a garbage can by Uncle Ambrose: Laurie whose prostitute mother was strangled to death; Adam and Jeff whose baby sister died waiting for medical attention in a clinic, pitching their mother into a mental institution; George who enjoyed the rare privilege of a father only to have it eroded by the degradation of \"\"Whitey.\"\" Danny and his friends mature into their individual roles of adjustment: social work, Civil Rights, crime or prostitution, an admixture of historical escapes and new-born resistances. When the ten days of riots erupt in July of 1067, Pine Street makes the papers for its \"\"Paradox\"\"--two black men shot by National Guardsmen attempting to rescue a 90-year-old woman from a burning house, and the dead body of a pregnant black girl flung in protection across the lifeless body of a while flower child.

He looked around upon the place, the houses, the lawns, and then a lighted window caught his eye and he realized that he was passing Bradford Waters' house. \"I wonder if she is back at home?\" he said. \"I caused her so much grief.\" He passed through the gate, and crept up to the window. The light shone through a thin shade, but he could see nothing within the house. After a short while, however, he heard the sound of women's voices, and one was hers. Without warning, all the pent-up feeling of the past three years burst forth in the cry, \" Mary!\" \"What's that?\" cried some one within, but there was no answer save the hurried tread of feet across the floor. Aware of what he had done, he was hurrying away, when the front door was thrown open, and he saw her before him standing in a flood of light. Then he could not go. He stood transfixed until she walked down the steps to him crying,\" Robert, Robert, I was sure you would come!\" And all he could do was to bow his head and murmur, \"Thank God.\" She took him by the hand and led him into the house, he unresisting. \"Here is Robert,\" she said to Nannie. \"Did I not tell you he would come?\" \"Yes, and I am glad with you.\" Her greeting of Robert was tender, almost sisterly. As soon as she could do so tactfully, she left the room, and Van Doren's glance followed her questioningly. He could not understand her subdued manner, her sad face.

Striving to serve the Lord, he is dragged into a “Great Crusade” which is nothing more than a publicity stunt that ends disastrously. Shahan’s day sees him ministering to the sick and dying, pacifying angry parishioners and counseling troubled ones, seeking inspiration for a sermon, trying to calm his mother by phone, and losing patience with his family. Pat Shahan is a thoroughly human minister.\n\nThroughout his day—and by extension his ministry—he struggles to balance his faith in Christianity with his doubts about himself and his church.
